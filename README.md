## 🌟 Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning is the art of teaching computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming. It's like giving machines the ability to think and make decisions!

```
Traditional Programming:  Data + Program → Output
Machine Learning:        Data + Output → Program (Model)
```

### Core Areas I'm Exploring:

🎯 **Supervised Learning** - Learning with labeled examples  
🔍 **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding hidden patterns  
🎮 **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through trial and reward  
🧠 **Deep Learning** - Neural networks and complex patterns  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
